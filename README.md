## Updates
#### Dev Update â€” July 6th, 2023 ðŸ¥°
We have relocated to a beautiful home in the suburbs of Frankfrut, DE. There has been a LOT of work unpacking, organizing, and landscaping to get this home perfect for our two toddlers! I am hoping to resume development of the theme in the next couple months!

On a really interesting note, Webflow has launched a React component export tool. I am considering moving all component design and management over to Webflow for easier tooling for marketing teams and visual designers! 
#### Dev Update â€” Feb 13th, 2023 [Updated: March 05th, 2023]
Jest has been setup, but no progress on building tests has been made. Life is busy atm! 
#### Dev Update â€” Feb 10th, 2019
Boxby is a project I built along with my team of 5 people in RMIT ITS Hackathon 2019. The theme was "An Equal Community", which led to the idea of building a platform that caches the internet and provides an isolated offline version.

The name Boxby was inspired by The Box from the TV series Silicon Valley.

Purpose of the project
Similar inventions to Boxby were built to solve the problem of social equality however, most of them were unsuccessful1. Despite the cheap price, such devices can not be considered useful if they provide no consequential benefit to the community.

By learning from the areas in which others have failed, we believe that limited education resource is the core problem which leads to social inequality. The Internet is the most powerful tool to help people to achieve better educational outcomes, however many areas and countries face limited to no internet connection with their devices. Rural areas in Australia are also known to face similar issues2.

## This website is still being developed! ðŸ¥³
The porftofolio application has currently hit the Beta phase and is ready to be forked if you are familiar with React and Next. The next release cycle will focus on a better DXâ€”moving from local JSON to MongoDB, setting up Sanity for GUI page editing, Unit Testing with Jest, adding TypeScript, etc.
And also using Docker and Github action workflow for deploying project.
My projects are using microservices such as Kafka apache stream server.

## Please fork this repo! ðŸ¦„

Fork, Install, Editing, and Deploy instructions coming soon(ish)!

This is my first open-source contribution, and it was also a great oppoortunity for me to learn! 

It is my hope that by sharing this project it can give others a chance to enjoy learning Nextjs (and have as much fun as I did), and hopefully brings value to people as a portfolio and networking tool
